## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. Naming Conventions
```html
<section class="question__section">
  <p class="question__text">What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?</p>
  <img class="question__image" src="assets/images/icon-minus.svg" alt="minus" />
  <p class="question__answer">
    Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges to help
    developers improve their frontend coding skills with projects in
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's suitable for all levels and ideal
    for portfolio building.
  </p>
</section>
```

2. Event listener 
```js
questions.addEventListener("keypress", eventFunction, false );
questions.addEventListener("click", eventFunction, false );

function eventFunction(event){
    if(event.target.classList.contains('question__text')) {
        showAnswer(event.target.closest('.question__section'))
    }
}
```

3. Grid
```css
.question__section {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: auto auto / 1fr 30px;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 1.5rem;
}
```
